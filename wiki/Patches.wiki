= Accepting patches =

We are accepting patches. 

Every change to the code is tracked by a  [http://code.google.com/p/vosao/issues/list Issue tracker] without a issue, code will not be reviewed, and without review, code will not be accepted. 

To avoid duplication, search for an existing issue about the change, and if none exists, file a new one. Most of the communication about code changes takes place in the issue, so be sure that the issue describes the exact problem being solved.

All changes must be tested. In most cases, an automated test is required for every change to the code. In some cases where it is not possible to write an automated test, manual tests are used.

Ensure that the change has not caused regressions by running the automated test suite, locally. 

Attach the finished patch to the issue using the "Add an attachment" link in issue tracker. 

Don't be afraid to post partial patches demonstrating potential approaches and ask for preliminary feedback on them. It is easier for others to comment and offer suggestions when a question is accompanied by code.

A patch can be committed after it has been properly reviewed.
