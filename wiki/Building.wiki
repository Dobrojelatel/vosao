= Building Vosao =

Vosao uses Maven2 as a project build tool. So you need maven2 configured on your system. 
To develop using Eclipse we recommend [http://m2eclipse.sonatype.org/ m2eclipse] plugin.

Unfortunately I was unable to make GAE/J Eclipse plugin to deploy the project so I recommend to use maven command line for deploying process.

Build project steps:

 # Download GAE/J SDK and unzip it for example to directory /opt/gae
 # Configure {vosao source}/ant.properties - set appengine.sdk.home var to "/opt/gae"
 # Download and configure maven2
 # If your application name is "testapp" then this command will build war file.
{{{
  > mvn -Dappname=testapp clean package
}}}
 # Run development server:
{{{
  > run.sh
}}}
 # Deploy to GAE
{{{
  > update.sh
}}}
